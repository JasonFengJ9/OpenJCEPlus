## Trademarks

Java and all Java-based trademarks are trademarks of Oracle Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both.

## Applicable Licenses

Apache-2.0. See included module OPENJCEPLUS_LICENCE file for details.

As part of a FIPS 140-3 technology preview capability, this Semeru Runtimes distribution includes a modified OpenSSL 1.1.1 toolkit binary that is currently undergoing FIPS 140-3 certification testing at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Because this toolkit version was built and submitted to NIST before we contributed its code to an open source project (now at https://github.com/IBM/OpenCryptographyKitC), the toolkit binary included in this release contains strings that reference an IBM license. These strings have been removed from the open-source version of the toolkit.
This notice supersedes the IBM license expressed in the binary itself. The toolkit binary for use with the FIPS 140-3 technology preview capability uses the OpenSSL 1.1.1 license (see OpenSSL third-party content referenced below) as well as the Apache License 2.0 (see OPENJCEPLUS_LICENCE).

### Cryptography

Content may contain encryption software. The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use, and/or re-export to
another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import,
possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.
